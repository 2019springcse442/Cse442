# Project Ideas (We haven't decided yet)
# 1) Find Professors - updated version of UB Directory and only including professors, this app is made to help students find professors' office hours and office locations. In addition, may include a direction guide from current location to the office
# 2) Find Your Match - aimed to help people find contacts of the type of girls/guys he/she likes by using algorithms
# 3) Web Cashier - Provided cashier functions to users for one-time event or multiple events, aimed to make cashier more available and easy to use for one-time user, instead of purchasing the physical machine.
# 4) Food Rating - exclusive for UB, identify all nearby restaruants and on-campus dining halls and let students rate and comment
# 5) UB Events Browser - organizations and clubs in UB can post their recent events with time, location and fee on the web. Can include alerts from school. It would look like a post from Instagram. Aimed to help to promote events and inform students.
